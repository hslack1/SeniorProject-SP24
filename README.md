### Purpose
This study investigates existing research on what factors influence a sequelâ€™s box office success, aiming to answer the important question: What factors influence the box office performance of movie sequels in the past 50 years? There are 2 hypotheses that will be tested through the course of this research. The first hypothesis is that movie number in a franchise has a positive relationship with movie revenue. The second hypothesis is that action movies are the highest grossing genre in terms of average revenue.


### Data
The data used in this research is from a public dataset on Kaggle constructed by a user who scraped the data from imdb.com and tmdb.com
